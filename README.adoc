## Installation

```
npm install uri-monitor
```



## API

### Constructor
```haskell
UriMonitor :: String URI, Int check_interval_ms -> UriMonitor
```

* `uri` The URI to monitor. Plain GET requests will be made against this.
* `interval_ms` The time between checks

`UriMonitor` is an instance of link:https://github.com/asyncly/EventEmitter2[EventEmitter2].


### Methods

##### #start()
```haskell
start :: -> UriMonitor
```

Begin the monitor; Boots a setInterval.

##### #stop()
```haskell
stop :: -> UriMonitor
```

Stop the monitor:
* kills the current setInterval
* Aborts the current request via link:http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#aborting-requests[`superagent.abort()`].

##### #check()
```haskell
check :: -> UriMonitor
```

Force a manual check. This is a totally independent check. It does not affect the start/stop system in any way. It does not affect the setInterval being run.

##### #on()
```haskell
on :: String event_name, (* -> void) -> UriMonitor
```
Listen for <<Events, events>>.



## Events

|===
| event name | callback arguments | description
| `check`  | `is_connected :: Boolean`, `response :: Check_Result` | A check result
| `change` | `is_connected :: Boolean`, `response :: Check_Result` | A check result, and it is different than the last check
| `pong` | `response :: Check_Result` | A check result that is a success
| `drop` | `response :: Check_Result` | A check result that is a failure
| `connection` | `response :: Check_Result` | A check result that is a success, and it is different than the last check
| `disconnection` | `response :: Check_Result` | A check result that is a failure, and it is different than the last check
|===



## Types

#### `CheckResult`

`superagent` has two types of request errors: general IO and response errors in the 400 or 500 range. URI Monitor treats both as a check failure. Result can be one of three things:

. If a successful request then the `superagent` link:http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#response-properties[`response`] object.

. If a failed request due to IO, then the link:http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#error-handling[`err`] as returned by `superagent`.

. If a failed request due to 4xx/5xx range response, then the link:http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#error-handling[`response.error`] as provided by `superagent`.
